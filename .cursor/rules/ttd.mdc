# Workflow for Feature Implementation
- Start by creating a new branch for the feature.
- Write failing tests before implementing any functionality.
- Generate minimal code to pass the tests.
- Commit changes after passing tests.
- Refactor code only after all tests pass.
- Run all tests before merging the branch into `develop`.
- Revert branch if any test fails during CI or manual testing.
- Merge only if all tests pass.

# Automated Prompts:
1. "Create a new branch for {feature_name}."
2. "Write a failing test for {feature_name}."
3. "Generate code to pass the test."
4. "Commit changes after passing tests."
5. "Run all tests and ensure they pass."
6. "Merge branch into `develop` if all tests pass."
7. "Revert branch if any test fails."
