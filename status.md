## Completed Features

We have successfully implemented the following features using Test-Driven Development (TDD):

1. **Basic Password Generation**
   - Password generation with configurable length (4-64 characters)
   - Length validation
   - 100% test coverage

2. **Configurable Character Sets**
   - Support for specifying which character categories to include
   - Options for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
   - Input validation to ensure at least one character set is selected
   - 100% test coverage

3. **Exclude Ambiguous Characters**
   - Option to exclude commonly confused characters (0/O, 1/l/I, etc.)
   - Customized filtering for each character category
   - 100% test coverage

4. **Pronounceable Passwords**
   - Generate readable passwords by combining syllables
   - Support for including digits, symbols, and capitalization
   - Syllable-based generation for natural-sounding passwords
   - 94% test coverage

5. **Password Strength Estimation**
   - Calculate entropy of passwords based on character set size
   - Classify password strength as Weak, Medium, or Strong
   - Consider length, complexity, and character diversity
   - 41% test coverage

## Remaining Features

The following feature is still to be implemented:

6. **Password History/Storage**
   - Store generated passwords for future reference
   - Allow users to retrieve passwords
   - Integration with system clipboard

## Next Steps

1. Improve test coverage for the Password Strength Estimation feature
2. Create comprehensive documentation
3. Package for distribution
4. Add more features in future versions:
   - Password history/storage
   - Password validation against common patterns
   - Integration with system clipboard
