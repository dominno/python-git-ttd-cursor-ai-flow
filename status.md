# passgen Project Status

## Completed Features

We have successfully implemented the following features using Test-Driven Development (TDD):

1. **Basic Password Generation**
   - Password generation with configurable length (4-64 characters)
   - Length validation
   - 100% test coverage

2. **Configurable Character Sets**
   - Support for specifying which character categories to include
   - Options for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
   - Input validation to ensure at least one character set is selected
   - 100% test coverage

3. **Exclude Ambiguous Characters**
   - Option to exclude commonly confused characters (0/O, 1/l/I, etc.)
   - Customized filtering for each character category
   - 100% test coverage

4. **Pronounceable Passwords**
   - Generate readable passwords by combining syllables
   - Support for including digits, symbols, and capitalization
   - Syllable-based generation for natural-sounding passwords
   - 94% test coverage

## Remaining Features

The following feature is still to be implemented:

5. **Password Strength Estimation**
   - Calculate entropy of passwords
   - Classify password strength (Weak, Medium, Strong)

## Next Steps

1. Create feature branch for password strength estimation
2. Write failing tests for password strength estimation
3. Implement password strength estimation
4. Prepare for release
5. Create comprehensive documentation
