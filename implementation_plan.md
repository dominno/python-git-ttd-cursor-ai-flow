# Implementation Plan for `passgen` Library

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `passgen` Python library following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and Git workflow.

## Project Setup

1. Create basic project structure
   - Create `src/passgen` package
   - Create `tests` directory
   - Add `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`
   - Add `.gitignore`

2. Set up testing framework
   - Set up pytest
   - Configure test coverage reporting

## Feature Implementation

For each feature, we'll follow this TDD workflow:
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. Refactor if needed
5. Run all tests and ensure they pass
6. Merge branch into `develop`

### Feature 1: Basic Password Generation

**Branch**: `feature/basic-password-generation`

**Tasks**:
1. Write tests for generating passwords with specified length
2. Implement core password generation functionality
3. Write tests for default character set
4. Implement default character set
5. Run tests and refactor

### Feature 2: Configurable Character Sets

**Branch**: `feature/configurable-character-sets`

**Tasks**:
1. Write tests for including/excluding character categories (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
2. Implement character category configuration
3. Run tests and refactor

### Feature 3: Exclude Ambiguous Characters

**Branch**: `feature/exclude-ambiguous-characters`

**Tasks**:
1. Write tests for excluding ambiguous characters like `0`, `O`, `l`, `1`
2. Implement ambiguous character exclusion
3. Run tests and refactor

### Feature 4: Pronounceable Passwords

**Branch**: `feature/pronounceable-passwords`

**Tasks**:
1. Write tests for generating pronounceable passwords
2. Implement syllable-based password generation
3. Run tests and refactor

### Feature 5: Password Strength Estimation

**Branch**: `feature/password-strength`

**Tasks**:
1. Write tests for password entropy calculation
2. Implement entropy calculation
3. Write tests for strength classification (Weak, Medium, Strong)
4. Implement strength classification
5. Run tests and refactor

## Documentation

**Branch**: `feature/documentation`

**Tasks**:
1. Add docstrings to all public modules, classes, and functions
2. Add type hints
3. Create README.md with usage examples
4. Create API documentation

## Git Workflow

1. Initialize repository with `main` and `develop` branches
2. Create feature branches for each implementation task
3. After completing each feature:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Merge feature branch into `develop`
4. When all features are complete, create a release branch
5. After testing the release, merge into `main` and tag as v1.0.0

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all components and functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Edge cases testing (empty inputs, boundary values)
- Test all configuration combinations

## Deliverables

1. Complete `passgen` Python package
2. Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage
3. Documentation and usage examples
4. PyPI-ready package structure
