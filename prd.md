## ðŸ“„ Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
### Project: `passgen` â€“ Secure & Configurable Password Generator (Pure Python Library)

---

### 1. **Objective**

Develop a pure Python library called `passgen` that generates secure, customizable passwords. It will be designed for developers, system administrators, and security-conscious users who want flexible password generation options.

The project will follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles, ensuring high test coverage, modular design, and maintainability.

### 2. **Core Features**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| âœ… Random Password Generation | Generate passwords with configurable length and character sets. |
| âœ… Configurable Rules | Enable or disable character categories (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols). |
| âœ… Avoid Ambiguous Characters | Optionally exclude ambiguous characters like `0`, `O`, `l`, `1`. |
| âœ… Pronounceable Mode | Generate readable passwords by combining syllables or pseudo-words. |
| âœ… Password Strength Estimation | Estimate entropy and classify password strength as Weak, Medium, or Strong. |

### 3. **Out of Scope (MVP)**

- GUI
- External API or web app
- Database or persistent storage
- Multilingual support

---

### 4. **Target Audience**

- Python developers
- System admins
- Penetration testers
- Hobbyists building CLI tools or secure systems

---

### 5. **User Stories**

#### ðŸ”¹ As a developer:
- I want to generate passwords with just a few lines of code.
- I want to easily configure the character types used in my passwords.

#### ðŸ”¹ As a sysadmin:
- I want to generate secure passwords that donâ€™t contain confusing characters.
- I want a quick way to estimate how strong a password is.

#### ðŸ”¹ As a privacy-conscious user:
- I want to create pronounceable passwords that are easy to remember but still strong.

### 6. **Functional Requirements**

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR1 | Generate password of specified length | High |
| FR2 | Include/exclude character categories | High |
| FR3 | Optionally exclude ambiguous characters | Medium |
| FR4 | Generate pronounceable passwords | Medium |
| FR5 | Estimate password strength (entropy) | Medium |
| FR6 | All features must be tested via TDD | High |

---

### 7. **Non-Functional Requirements**

- âœ… 100% unit test coverage
- âœ… Pure Python, no external dependencies
- âœ… Well-documented code with type hints
- âœ… PEP8-compliant
- âœ… Clear public API
